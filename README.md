# London House Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes house price trends in different boroughs of London over the past two decades. We investigate which boroughs have experienced the highest increase in house prices and compare the average price changes from 1998 to 2018.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical house prices for London boroughs from **1995 to 2024**. Data has been cleaned and transformed to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives
- Identify boroughs with the **greatest house price increase** over two decades.
- Visualize **monthly and yearly trends** of house prices.
- Compute **house price ratios** comparing 1998 to 2018 prices.
- Generate **line plots and bar charts** for better interpretation.
